### ‚ùî FAQ

#### How many free domain names can be registered? üöÄ  
Currently, the limit is 3. Due to the high volume of domain abuse, we are no longer reviewing applications to expand the domain registration limit. However, we may reopen the option to request limit expansions in the future. In the meantime, you can set up subdomains via your DNS panel (e.g., example.foo.us.kg).

#### Which DNS platforms can I use this domain with?  
You can use it with virtually any DNS management system! Just input the provided platform‚Äôs NS records or your own into the DigitalPlat FreeDomain panel (e.g., Try Cloudflare if you're not sure).
